# Capson-Cloud-Devops

In this project I ran EC2 an S3 bucket on AWS and I used IAM roles to access this instance.

First of all, I accessed the instance using this command.  All the names mentioned is just as an example.

'''ssh -i "XXXX.pem" user@ec2-XX-XXX-XX-XXX.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com '''

In this instance, I installed Jenkins by runnig this script script file called install_jenkins.sh

Moreover, I changed the default password
